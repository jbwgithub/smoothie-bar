# Smoothie Bar

Thanks for taking a look at my app: Smoothie Bar

Currently still under development, this web app is an online solution for a summer smoothie bar. Visitors to the website will be able to view the menu online and place their orders before leaving the dock to go pick up their cold smoothies. This allows the business more time to preapre will the customers are on route, and saves the cusyomer time when they arrive and their order is ready to go!

## Tech Stack

For this project I am using the following technologies/frameworks:

* React (for Frontend)
* Express (for API)
* Axios (for requests)
* Node (Backend server)
* PostgreSQL (for databse)
* Travis (for CI/CD, currently fixing errors in .yaml file)
